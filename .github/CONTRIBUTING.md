# Contribution Guidelines

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this website! Here are a few guidelines that will help accelerate your process.

## What are good things to contribute?
- Code that resolves [any open issues](https://github.com/kjy5/honors-portfolio/issues) **not pertaining to website content**. Website content would mean artifacts I would add to my honors portfolio.
- Add new issues highlighting bugs you have found!
- Code that fixes bugs you have found!

## Steps to contribute
1. Create an issue detailing what you want to accomplish
2. Fork this repo and make your changes
3. Make a pull request, referencing the issue you made in step #1 (use the "fixes" or "closes" keywords to link your issue to the PR)
4. I'll review and merge the PR if it looks good to me!

## Where can I find documentation for how to contribute
- I heavily comment my code in JSDoc style
- The [Wiki](https://github.com/kjy5/honors-portfolio/wiki) for this repo contains pertinent info for coding
