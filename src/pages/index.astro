        <h1>Kenneth's Honors Portfolio</h1>
        <p><b>Hi üëã I'm Kenneth Yang.</b></p>
        <p>
          I studied Computer Science and minored in Digital Arts & Experimental
          Media with college honors as part of the UW's class of 2025.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>I learn best by doing</i>. I used research as the surface I would
          apply my education towards, solidifying my coursework and also
          developing my skills to be career researcher in computer graphics.
          Along the way, I worked my leadership and communication skills as
          captain of UW's swim club and found my artistic outlet through
          photography and filmmaking. This portfolio details my journey through
          UW and how I shaped by experiences to learn better by doing.
