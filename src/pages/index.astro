        <h1>Kenneth's Honors Portfolio</h1>
        <p><b>Hi 👋 I'm Kenneth Yang.</b></p>
        <p>
          I studied Computer Science and minored in Digital Arts & Experimental
          Media with college honors as part of the UW's class of 2025.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          I learn best by doing. Having a practical place to use things I have learned has
          been the best way for me to solidify new concepts. At UW, I used my personal,
          club, and research projects as the practical place where I could apply my
          coursework and learn by doing.
          
          <br/>
          
          Computer Science is an "arts and science" degree. I embraced the
          interdisciplinary nature of this field through my focus on computer graphics
          where I developed as both a scientist and an artist.
