        <p><b>Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Kenneth Yang.</b></p>
        <p>
          I studied Computer Science and minored in Digital Arts & Experimental
          Media with college honors as part of the class of 2025.
        </p>
        <p>
          This portfolio documents my academic journey at UW as I pursue
          academic research in computer graphics to allow me to <i
            >learn by doing</i
          >. In addition to reflecting on my learning, I also wanted to share
          the side quests I took into photography and competitive swimming,
          which have become integral parts of my social life and personal growth
          outside of academia.
        </p>
