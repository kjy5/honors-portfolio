# Captaining for the UW Swim Club

One of the most rewarding experiences I had at the University of Washington was being a captain for the UW Swim Club. It was a role that allowed me to combine my passion for swimming with leadership and community building. As a captain, I was responsible for organizing practices and leading the team at competitions. I become a point of contact for new members and was the one people could turn to for advice and support. Swimming has largely been an individual sport for me since I was always focused on my own performance, but being a captain made me realize how much I could contribute to the team dynamic and help others improve. I realize I could bring in the best parts of the sport that I loved from competitive club swimming in high school while also creating an inclusive and supportive environment for suitable for the college club team dynamic.
