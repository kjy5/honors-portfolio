# CSE Departmental Honors

## Improving 3D Gaussian Splatting Rasterization Performance

I face a chain of prerequisites if I were to achieve my career goals of industry
research in computer graphics. Any research scientist position requires a
doctorate degree. To gain one, I must first engage in computer science research
and make reputable contributions, so I may apply to be a PhD student.

With my previous work in the Steinmetz Lab, I have demonstrated my ability to be
a strong researcher in the field of computer graphics and robotics. However,
this was in the field of neuroscience. After my work with Professor Michael
Ernst in software engineering research, I transitioned to working with Professor
Gilbert Bernstein on a computer graphics research project. This project is the
topic of my departmental honors in CSE.

My experience in research enabled me to hit the ground running and push the
project forward with significant velocity. I hope to continue my research with
Professor Bernstein with a fifth-year masterâ€™s degree and turn my contributions
into a publication that I can use when applying to PhD programs. These are all
important steps to achieving my career goals of becoming a research scientist in
computer graphics.
