# Leadership Experiential Learning

This leadership experiential learning project has allowed me to be a person in charge and someone others depend on in a professional setting. Throughout the quarter, I connected with our partners at Sensapex and New Scale in addition to individual labs to help guide them in getting our software working in labs and lead informational events. For these people, I was their point of contact for any technical support and their source for information on how our product worked. I was responsible for both their success in their research and guiding their experience with our tools.

One particular case I worked on was with Kerry Nix from Tim Machado's lab at the University of Pennsylvania. Over a couple of weeks through email, I worked with Kerry Nix, a PhD student, to get Pinpoint and Ephys Link installed and set up for her lab. I was able to help troubleshoot issues she was having as well as create refined instructions and tutorials to share with others. Through this experience, I also refined my own onboarding process, and I will be looking to utilize it in an upcoming big push to onboard more labs.

I also started planning an informational webinar with our partners at New Scale to help spread the word about our software to more labs and get them started with using Pinpoint. The timescale of research is slower than one quarter's worth of time, so things are still ongoing, and more labs are yet to be onboarded, but the progress made was definitely tangible!

Overall, I could consider this experience a success and my views of leadership stay the same. I enjoy this process and look forward to working with our partners and new labs in the coming weeks!
