# COSMOS Interface and CSE 351

![interface](../../../assets/scientist/cosmos.avif)

Husky Satellite Lab (HSL) builds satellites for space research, requiring
communication systems to interface with satellites in orbit—which is where my
project comes in.

This project embodies my "learning by doing" philosophy through practical
application. Before joining research labs, I started with club involvement as an
accessible entry point to apply theoretical knowledge in real-world contexts.
HSL became ideal for this hands-on approach.

To prepare for satellite communication's low-level programming demands, I
strategically took CSE 351 (Hardware/Software Interface), gaining foundational
understanding of software-hardware interfaces essential for ground station
systems that communicate with satellites in space.

I'm building and deploying a ground station system using COSMOS and OpenSatKit,
enabling HSL to design graphical tools and interfaces for satellite equipment.
This represents exactly the practical application that solidifies
learning—actively building systems for real space missions rather than just
studying theory. Working with COSMOS taught me advanced software systems used in
professional spaceflight while developing cross-team communication skills.

This project served as a starting point in my research journey, showing how club
participation provided practical foundation and confidence before transitioning
to formal research labs. Building mission-critical systems while collaborating
with interdisciplinary teams perfectly aligned with my goal of applying
theoretical knowledge in research contexts with real-world impact.
