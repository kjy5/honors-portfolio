# CSE 512 and Neuroscience Visualization

Participating in CSE 512, Jeff Heer's graduate-level visualization course, exemplified my learning philosophy of applying theoretical concepts practically while providing invaluable insight into graduate education. Having worked with Professor Heer through my lab previously, I was already familiar with his research approach, which made this course particularly meaningful for bridging my undergraduate and future graduate experiences.

The course structure perfectly aligned with my belief that learning happens best through doing—students were explicitly invited to bring their own research projects into the classroom and apply newly taught concepts to enhance their work. This direct application approach allowed me to seamlessly tie my education to my ongoing research, taking interaction concepts like live filtering and brushing to simulate electrophysiology experiments and explore various inputs for my neuroscience automation tools.

This experience gave me a genuine glimpse into what graduate school would be like, and I found myself thriving in the environment where research and coursework intersected so naturally. The ability to immediately apply classroom learning to my research projects reinforced my commitment to pursuing graduate studies in computer graphics. Rather than treating coursework and research as separate endeavors, CSE 512 demonstrated how they could enhance each other—a model that excites me about continuing this interdisciplinary, hands-on approach in graduate school where the scientist and researcher within me can continue to grow through practical application and discovery.
