# SfN 2024

## Returning to the largest Neuroscience conference in the U.S.

This was a highlight of my undergraduate research career. I was an important,
contributing, member of the neuroscience community (as a computer scientist) and
people in the industry depended on my work and sought out my expertise. I
effectively applied my computer science coursework and skills across
disciplines.

This was my second time attending SfN and I got the chance to be a returning
face in the community! This year, I was registered as an exhibitor with Sensapex
and a poster presenter. This extra credential allowed me to showcase my work to
potential customers at the Sensapex exhibit booth and talk to them as a partner
of Sensapex. I geared more of my focus this year on networking with various
industry partners and expanding the reach of my project, Pinpoint. Now that I
was more familiar with who was in attendance and how many vendors knew about my
project, I was able to establish new partnerships. I was able to speak with the
representatives from Scientifica and LabMaker and establish partnerships with
them to integrate their manipulator platforms into Pinpoint. I felt this year
that I was breaking out of the learning phase of conference-going and could use
the networking opportunity to push my project forward.
