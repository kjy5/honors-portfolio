# Research Experiential Learning Activity

## Pinpoint: Electrophysiology Planning Tool Project in the Virtual Brain Lab, Steinmetz Lab

I made it into a lab and got to start applying my computer science skills to a
project with real-world impact. This lab would play an instrumental role in my
undergraduate career.

Over the summer I got to start working in the Virtual Brain Lab, a group within
the Steinmetz Lab for neuroscience at the University of Washington led by Dr.
Dan Birman. I got the amazing opportunity to exercise my CS skills in an
environment that had real impacts on the wider neuroscience community. My work
continued through the fall quarter as an experiential learning activity. Thus
far, Iâ€™ve learned so much from this project including working in teams,
presenting my developments to peers, and receiving feedback from other
neuroscience experts from around the world. My work was shared at the 2022
Society for Neuroscience (SfN) conference, one of the largest neuroscience
conferences held annually. We gained a lot of interest in our development of
Pinpoint including new partner companies such as New Scale who are interested in
using our tools for their electrophysiology equipment. I look forward to
continuing working in the Steinmetz Lab and developing Pinpoint!
