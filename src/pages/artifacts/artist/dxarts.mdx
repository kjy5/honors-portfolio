# DXARTS Video Series

This is definitely one of the more unexpected things I ended up doing at UW. My initial discovery of DXARTS was when I was looking for classes I cold take ot fulfill my arts and humanities credits. I don't mind the arts, it the readings and essay writing I would like to avoid. DXARTS happened to have a video series dedicated to practicing making films. It turns out that if I do the video series and a couple other classes, I can get a minor in DXARTS while also completely fulfilling my A&H requireemtns.

I joined and never regretted it! Taking these classes after taking DRAMA 406 was a great way to continue practicing my filmmaking skills and learn more about the art of storytelling through video. DXARTS also has a collection of very high-end equipment most peple can't find anywhere else. This became a great resource for me to continue practicing my artistic skills and also provide me with a platform for artistic expression while also fostering my directing/leading capabilities.
