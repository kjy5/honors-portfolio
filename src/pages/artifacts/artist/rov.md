# ROV Renders

UWROV gave me a chance to apply my computer graphics background in a practical setting while working across different teams. Being involved with both the mechanical and software subgroups meant I could see how each group approached problems differently, which helped when I led the promotional material project for the club's website.

This project was a natural fit for combining my computer science skills with visual techniques I'd been developing. Instead of just taking standard photos of the ROV, I could think about lighting, composition, and how to highlight the mechanical details that the team had worked so hard on. My computer graphics experience helped me understand what would translate well visually and what technical aspects were worth emphasizing.

Working between the two groups required the same kind of collaborative approach I'd been practicing as swim team captain—figuring out what each group needed and finding ways to make everyone's priorities work together. The mechanical team wanted their engineering work showcased properly, while the software team needed content that would work well on the website.

This project reinforced something I'd been learning through my research work: some of the most interesting problems happen when you can bring together different skill sets. It wasn't groundbreaking work, but it was a good example of how my interdisciplinary approach—blending technical knowledge with visual thinking—could create something useful for the whole team.
