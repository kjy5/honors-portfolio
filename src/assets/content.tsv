The team is composed of several distinct subgroups working together towards a common goal. Working on both the mechanical and software subgroup allowed me to gain experience with handling cross-team communications and collaborations. These images of the ROV are a collaboration between the mechanical group and software team to create improved promotional material to be featured on the club’s website. Leading the effort on this project allowed me to practice facilitating planning and collaboration between the two groups to achieve the goal of highlighting the mechanical achievements of the mechanical group and improving the club’s website (ran by the software group).

Essentially, a list of correlations of things (like a word to a definition in a dictionary). While this was a topic that wasn’t unfamiliar to me, I enjoyed the application and practice I got from using such a simple system to create a fun game. Evil Hangman takes the standard hangman game and twists it to make it nearly impossible to win by constantly changing the correct word based on the input the player gives. Because of my prior experiences with CS, a lot of topics covered in CSE 143 were not unfamiliar to me, but it was through the extra/targeted practice and structured assignments that I came to have a better understanding and appreciation for these concepts.

For all these goals to be achieved, however, the team must have some way to communicate and interface with the satellite while it’s out in space. This is where the project I’m working on comes in. I’m learning how to build and deploy a ground station system built on COSMOS and OpenSatKit which will allow HSL to design graphical tools and interfaces for the various equipment and tools that will go onboard the satellite. Learning COSMOS and working at HSL allowed me to learn a lot about utilizing advanced software systems (used in professional spaceflight) and in cross-team communication and teamwork (to build tools and interfaces for the satellite).
