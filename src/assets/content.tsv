0   	0      	Nautilus Renders       	UWROV mechanical x website team project	nautilus        	UWROV is a competition-focused club that works to build underwater remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) which will compete at the annual MATE ROV Competition. The team is composed of several distinct subgroups working together towards a common goal. Working on both the mechanical and software subgroup allowed me to gain experience with handling cross-team communications and collaborations. These images of the ROV are a collaboration between the mechanical group and software team to create improved promotional material to be featured on the club’s website. Leading the effort on this project allowed me to practice facilitating planning and collaboration between the two groups to achieve the goal of highlighting the mechanical achievements of the mechanical group and improving the club’s website (ran by the software group).
0   	0      	Evil Hangman           	A fun CSE 143 Assignment               	evil_hangman    	This CSE 143 computer science assignment was focused on a CS topic known as maps or dictionaries. Essentially, a list of correlations of things (like a word to a definition in a dictionary). While this was a topic that wasn’t unfamiliar to me, I enjoyed the application and practice I got from using such a simple system to create a fun game. Evil Hangman takes the standard hangman game and twists it to make it nearly impossible to win by constantly changing the correct word based on the input the player gives. Because of my prior experiences with CS, a lot of topics covered in CSE 143 were not unfamiliar to me, but it was through the extra/targeted practice and structured assignments that I came to have a better understanding and appreciation for these concepts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       	https://replit.com/@kjy5/Evil-Hangman-Demo?embed=true
0   	0      	COSMOS Interface       	HSL intro project                      	cosmos_interface	Husky Satellite Lab (HSL) is focused on building satellites to launch into space and designing tools and equipment which can be used to conduct real research out in space. For all these goals to be achieved, however, the team must have some way to communicate and interface with the satellite while it’s out in space. This is where the project I’m working on comes in. I’m learning how to build and deploy a ground station system built on COSMOS and OpenSatKit which will allow HSL to design graphical tools and interfaces for the various equipment and tools that will go onboard the satellite. Learning COSMOS and working at HSL allowed me to learn a lot about utilizing advanced software systems (used in professional spaceflight) and in cross-team communication and teamwork (to build tools and interfaces for the satellite).
0   	0      	Fall Quarter Reflection	Thoughts on my first quarter in college	reflection      	Not a whole lot has changed about my expectations and goals for the year since I started. I have grown more comfortable with the daily routines and learned a lot more about different resources (as in study spaces and which places offer the best food) which has greatly improved my ability to work and achieve my academic goals, but in general, I’ve held onto the same level of academic rigor I hoped I would be able to achieve. Time management, a skill I’m very glad I was able to learn and hone while in high school, was incredibly useful here as I have learned that the vast amount of unstructured time allows for a lot of use was to schedule out my day. There were days when I would need to prioritize a certain exam over my homework, and because homework in some classes did not have a strict structure on due dates and turn-in time, I could put it off to the side in favor of studying for an important exam. This fluidity in planning is something I greatly enjoy and while I was under the impression that college would operate somewhat like this, I was very pleased to be able to experience it for real.\nOne thing that did stand out to me in a negative way was the competitive nature of class registrations. Because my high school didn’t believe in AP testing, I came in with freshman standing, meaning I had zero priority for registering for classes. Because of this, I was unable to register for some required courses in my major next quarter and will instead be taking electives I had planned to do further in the future. In contrast, many of my peers (in the honors program) already have junior standing which allowed them to grab all the necessary classes for their major/track and a lot of the more interesting honors courses. I hope in later years I will be able to enjoy the same situation they are in now. While I understand that this situation is likely to occur given that I’m attending a large university, it is still quite frustrating to experience it. UW does have useful tools built into MyPlan and the registration system which allows for dynamic class planning and getting notified for class openings, so this did help my situation quite a bit.\nHaving attended much smaller schools during my secondary education, I grew quite accustomed to teachers knowing me by my face and name. Understandably this is very difficult for a college professor to achieve, but I hope at the end of my first year I hope to be able to build some level of rapport and recognition with my professors and learn more about what they do outside of teaching. I hope this to be particularly true of my honors classes which often enjoy much smaller class sizes, meaning there will be higher levels of engagement with the professor. Because UW is a research-focused institution, most of my professors conduct research outside of class. I’m very interested in participating in undergraduate research myself and the first step to accomplishing this is to get to know professors and get them to also know me. If I make a conscious effort to make myself known to my professors, I believe I will be able to learn a lot more from them and perhaps be able to participate in the cool research they conduct outside of class.
