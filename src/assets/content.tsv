0	1	Starting a New Honors Portfolio Website	Combining my creativity and tech	new_website	1		I love creating things am learning about new technologies along the way. My Honors Portfolio, and any other website for that matter, is a great reason to do just that! I wanted my portfolios and websites for school to reflect my technological interests as well as my creative side. To do so I learned how to utilize modern web frameworks such as React, Vite, and Three.js as well as continuous integration system like GitHub Action to both create a technologically advanced website as well as display my 3D art. As I work to build this new website, learning these modern web technologies will also let me be more useful in web development jobs and other scenarios which call for these technologies.
0	1	ROV22 Simulation Demo	Designing and testing ROV22	rov22		1	As I continue my work in UWROV, I worked on another project which tied together the software and mechanical teams. To test motor configurations and movement for our new ROV design, I worked to implement CAD model designs from the mechanical team into a fluid simulator to test how they would behave. The software team could also pick up from here and run motor code directly against the ROV in the simulator to test behavior. In this project, I learned about the Gazebo simulator and sharpened my ROS, CAD, and cross-team communication skills.
0	1	Leadership and Democracy Final Paper	A culmination of HONORS 231 E	the_door		1	This final paper was a culmination of the concepts I learned in HONORS 231 E “Leadership, Democracy, and a More Thoughtful Public”. A big emphasis in the class was the idea of “implications”, or asking the questions “if this were true, what would that mean for society?” To tackle this in my final paper, I wrote a short story that played out three different propositions from the course and simulated what I believe would happen to characters and the surrounding society. Through this process I practiced a different way to communicate my thoughts (in the form of a story) and how to write creatively for an academic setting.
0	0	Nautilus Renders	UWROV mechanical x website team project	nautilus	1		UWROV is a competition-focused club that works to build underwater remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) which will compete at the annual MATE ROV Competition. The team is composed of several distinct subgroups working together towards a common goal. Working on both the mechanical and software subgroup allowed me to gain experience with handling cross-team communications and collaborations. These images of the ROV are a collaboration between the mechanical group and software team to create improved promotional material to be featured on the club’s website. Leading the effort on this project allowed me to practice facilitating planning and collaboration between the two groups to achieve the goal of highlighting the mechanical achievements of the mechanical group and improving the club’s website (ran by the software group).
0	0	Evil Hangman	A fun CSE 143 Assignment	evil_hangman		1	This CSE 143 computer science assignment was focused on a CS topic known as maps or dictionaries. Essentially, a list of correlations of things (like a word to a definition in a dictionary). While this was a topic that wasn’t unfamiliar to me, I enjoyed the application and practice I got from using such a simple system to create a fun game. Evil Hangman takes the standard hangman game and twists it to make it nearly impossible to win by constantly changing the correct word based on the input the player gives. Because of my prior experiences with CS, a lot of topics covered in CSE 143 were not unfamiliar to me, but it was through the extra/targeted practice and structured assignments that I came to have a better understanding and appreciation for these concepts.
0	0	COSMOS Interface	HSL intro project	cosmos_interface	1		Husky Satellite Lab (HSL) is focused on building satellites to launch into space and designing tools and equipment which can be used to conduct real research out in space. For all these goals to be achieved, however, the team must have some way to communicate and interface with the satellite while it’s out in space. This is where the project I’m working on comes in. I’m learning how to build and deploy a ground station system built on COSMOS and OpenSatKit which will allow HSL to design graphical tools and interfaces for the various equipment and tools that will go onboard the satellite. Learning COSMOS and working at HSL allowed me to learn a lot about utilizing advanced software systems (used in professional spaceflight) and in cross-team communication and teamwork (to build tools and interfaces for the satellite).
