## To setup for development
1. Install `npm` (probably by installing `node`)
2. Clone the repo
3. `npm i` to install dependencies
4. Run code with development server with `npm run dev`
5. Preview production build with `npm run preview`
6. Just build for production `npm run build` (output is in `/dist` folder)

**NOTE:** GitHub Actions have been set up to build and deploy to GitHub Pages, so a production build locally is not needed.
